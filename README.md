- **Feed Parsing**: Support for both RSS and ATOM feeds.
- **User Interface**: An intuitive and responsive UI to browse and read feeds.
- **Feed Management**: Add, remove, categorize, and tag feeds.
- **Search and Filter**: Powerful search and filtering options for articles.
- **Notifications**: Real-time updates for new content.
- **Performance**: Optimized for fast and efficient performance.
